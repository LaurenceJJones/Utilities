### Detect Dupes
----------------
<p> Takes a folder as input full of items EG: Images, Documents and videos. Also outputs to a destination folder that has all items arranged into seperate folders so if there is any duplicates they are neatly stored.
</br></br>
Could be altered to create symlinks between dupes so you could only stored items once on a server but keeps reference to the item in multiple locations</p>
