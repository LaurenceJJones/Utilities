# Utilities
Bunch of useful script snippets that can easily be reused

### Detect Dupes
----------------
<p> Takes a folder as input full of items EG: Images, Documents and videos. Also outputs to a destination folder that has all items arranged into seperate folders so if there is any duplicates they are neatly stored.
</br></br>
Could be altered to create symlinks between dupes so you could only stored items once on a server but keeps reference to the item in multiple locations</p>

### Rec Folder2Files
----------------
<p> This was made to use in conjunction with Detect Dupes script as this goes through all sub folders within a directory and spits all files into a big folder </p>
</br></br>
